All the code can run based on the number from 1-5
1: Seperate original dataset to 2012 and 2013, dToU and nonToU group, then seperate A-Q categories according to their income level. 
    Here only learn the price response function of group A, all the other group can use the same method.
2: Calculate the average consumers' demand by time (365 day * 48 time slot)
3: Generate input and output data, the file name is 'trainA.mat'
4: Train the machine learning network, including NN, SVR, XGBoost, and LSTM
5: Calculate the paramters of price response function, including linear type (1) and nonlinear type (2).
